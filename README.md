# WordleGame

Programmed the famous wordle game using Java programming language for my Advanced Programming course's project. The idea is that program picks a five lettered word and the user is trying to find it. They can guess five times. If the word they guessed is wrong but has letters that is also in the wanted word but in the wrong place, the letter's box lights yellow. If the letter is also in the wanted word and is also in the right place, letter lights green.
